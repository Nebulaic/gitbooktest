# Adding Content to Your App

Now that you've created your App, you'll be presented with your App dashboard. For now, we'll stick to a single "Home" page. Hover over the Home page, and click _Design_ to start editing the Home page in the _**App Designer**._

The App Designer has several parts. The two you'll be presented with on opening the App Dashboard are:

1. **The Components Panel** - this is the large menu to the left of the screen, containing all of the components you can use to add content to the page
2. **The Canvas** - the white canvas in the centre of the page, where you can drag components and preview the layout of your page

Before we drag _Components_ onto the page, we need to give it some structure. We can do this using the _Layouts_. Drag the _Hero_ layout onto the canvas.

![The Properties Panel](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2851%29.png)

The Hero will appear on the canvas, alongside the _Properties_ panel to the right. The properties panel is used \(surprise, surprise!\) to set the properties of the hero layout, including its size, font, background etc.

Now we've got some structure to the page, let's add a _Text_ component by dragging it **inside** _****_the Hero layout. This will be the title for our cool new App! Edit its size using the Properties panel.

Now, add a _Form Layout_ inside of the _Text_ component. Inside of this new layout, add a another _Text_ component, a _Text Input_ and a _Button._ We'll also add an _Image_ component. Save your work by clicking the floppy disk icon in the top-right of the App Designer.

Click the magnifying glass in the top-right of the App Designer to _Preview_ your page.

For now, you can enter text in the Text Input and hit the SUBMIT button - but nothing will happen! In the next section, we'll setup our Automation project so that we can actually do something of value with our App.
