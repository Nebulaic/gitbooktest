# Creating Your App

To get started, login into your Toca account at genesis.tocabot._yourdomain:_

![Login Form](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2846%29.png)

You'll be presented with your Home page. On the left navigation menu, click on "Projects" to see all your current projects.

On the projects page, you'll be presented with an overview of any projects you've built. Projects come in two types:

* **App Projects** - used to build a web-based application interface for your clients/users to interact with
* **Automation Projects** - used to automate administrative services, build Workflows, manage Datastores, interface with external APIs etc.

Click on _**Create your first project**_, then use the App Creation Wizard pop-up to name your project and set its properties such as its favicon. Be sure to leave _linked resources, favicon,_ and _restrict access_ for now by tapping _**Next**_ ****- we'll come back to these later when we connect our App to our Automation.
