# Creating Your Automation Project

An Automation Project is comprised of four components:

* **Activities** - pre-programmed processes that perform a series of operations to retrieve, manipulate, and return data
* **Datastores** - unstructured databases that can store data 
* **Workflows** - modelling tools used to perform high-level logical operations in which Activities are called and data is passed between services
* **Schedules** - processes that trigger a workflow at regular intervals

We won't be using Schedules for this project, but you can find out more about them [here](https://docs.toca.io/knowledge/scheduling-a-workflow).

Let's return to the Projects page, and select _Create your first project_ under Automation.

You'll be presented with the Automation Project dashboard. The dashboard provides you with a summary of any and all Activities, Workflows, Datastores, and Schedules. There's nothing to see here right now! At the top of the page, click _Add Datastore._

Now, we'll head back to the projects page and create a new Activity by clicking _Add Activity_. We'll need to assign a Bot to fetch our image.

Click _Create_ to be taken to the Activity Designer.

We'll click More as shown to add more Actions to the toolbox on the left-hand side.

Select any actions you'd like to add and hit _Update_. They'll appear on the left in your toolbox. Okay, we're all set up! In the next section, we'll look at how we can use Actions to get a picture of our favourite animal.
